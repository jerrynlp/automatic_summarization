Then later that day Zoe let Zayn sneak into her room while Zoe parents were asleep and - big shock - these horny bastards didn't have sex but instead Zayn chose to get all deep and told her that he's fallen for her and Zoe got sort of speechless and then they fell asleep..and that's what you missed on glee!"/>
